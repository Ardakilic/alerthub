AlertHub is a simple tool written with NodeJS to get alerted from GitHub and GitLab releases, tags and commits.

When you watch a release over GitHub, you also auto watch the issues and comments etc., however if you want to only follow new releases, or only commits or tags, there isn't a way to achieve this from GitHub directly.

There's been a service called sibbell.com, but they shut down on 15th May, 2018. That's why, I decided to make one for myself.

This simple cli tool watches the releases set in config, and notifies you with E-mail or PushBullet, and provides you an aggregated RSS feed which you can use in IFTTT or your personal feed reader.

**Update 2018.11.28:** GitHub now supports following the repositories' releases, however, it's still buggy for me, and they still don't cover the push notification feature which this tool offers.

## Features

Some people still wonder why this tool, which was released before GitHub release feature announced, yet exists, so I wanted to list the features as a bullet list:

* You can watch GitHub releases, tags, commits and issues
* ~~You can also watch private GitHub repositories by providing an access token~~
* You can watch GitLab tags and commits
* You can watch 3rd party releases which are neither from GitHub nor GitLab
* You can get notified with e-mail when a new update to your watch list is published
* You can also get notified with push notification, using services PushBullet and / or PushOver
* You can also get notified using Telegram bots. Just put your bot to the channels, or get your chat id, provide the bot token and your updates will be carried through the Telegram bot.
* You can generate an aggreagated RSS feed with this tool for all your watches, which is sorted by date, and use this aggregated feed to source to your favorite news reader application, or to pipe to services such as IFTTT etc.
* Self-hosted. Also, no GUI. You can simply set it and forget it

## Requirements

* NodeJS 20.x or newer
* (Optional) PushBullet Api Key
* (Optional) PushOver Api Key
* (Optional) SMTP credentials to dispatch e-mail
* (Optional) Telegram API key and Chat ID for the messages to be dispatched.

## Installation

You can install and run AlertHub with some simple steps:

1. Clone this repository or get the latest release version.
2. Navigate to the repository's folder, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your configuration values.

## Development with Docker

AlertHub includes a comprehensive Makefile that runs all commands through Docker, ensuring a consistent development environment across different systems.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- No need for Node.js locally - everything runs in containers

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ardakilic/alerthub.git
cd alerthub

# Install dependencies
make install

# Initialize environment file
make init

# Run tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run linting
make lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
make lint-fix

# Start the application
make start
```

### Available Make Commands

| Command | Description | Docker Equivalent |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `make help` | Show all available commands | - |
| `make install` | Install dependencies | `docker run ... npm install` |
| `make test` | Run all tests | `docker run ... npm test` |
| `make test-watch` | Run tests in watch mode | `docker run ... npm run test:watch` |
| `make test-coverage` | Run tests with coverage report | `docker run ... npm run test:coverage` |
| `make lint` | Run code linting | `docker run ... npm run lint` |
| `make lint-fix` | Auto-fix linting issues | `docker run ... npm run lint:fix` |
| `make start` | Start the application | `docker run ... npm start` |
| `make init` | Initialize .env file | `docker run ... npm run init` |
| `make clean` | Clean node_modules and coverage | `docker run ... rm -rf node_modules coverage` |
| `make shell` | Open interactive shell in container | `docker run -it ... /bin/bash` |
| `make check` | Run lint + test | `make lint test` |
| `make check-all` | Run lint + test with coverage | `make lint test-coverage` |

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites for all utilities:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with detailed coverage report
make test-coverage

# Watch mode for development
make test-watch

# Run specific test files (using shell)
make shell
npm test rssGenerator.test.js
npm test rssMonitor.test.js
```

### Code Quality

The project uses Biome for fast linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code quality
make lint

# Automatically fix issues
make lint-fix

# Check everything (lint + test + coverage)
make check-all
```

### Docker Details

All commands run in a Node.js 22 container with:
- **Image**: `node:22`
- **Working Directory**: `/app` (mapped to your project folder)
- **Environment**: `NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules"` for ES modules support
- **Volume Mount**: Your project directory is mounted for live development

### Manual Docker Commands

If you prefer running Docker commands directly:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app -e NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules" node:22 npm run test:coverage

# Run linting
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app -e NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules" node:22 npm run lint

# Start the application
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app -e NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules" node:22 npm start

# Interactive shell for debugging
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app -e NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules" node:22 /bin/bash
```

### CI/CD Integration

For continuous integration, use the CI-specific targets:

```bash
# Run complete test suite with coverage for CI
make ci-test

# Run linting for CI
make ci-lint
```

These generate coverage reports in the `./coverage/` directory that can be uploaded to coverage services.
4. Run `npm start` or something like `pm2 start npm -- start` and run the application.

## Configuration
