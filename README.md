AlertHub is a simple tool written with NodeJS to get alerted from GitHub releases.

When you watch a release, you also auto watch the issues and comments etc., however if you want to only follow new releases, there isn't a way to achieve this from GitHub directly.

There's been a service called sibbell.com, but they'll be shutting down on 15th May, 2018. That's why, I decided to make one for myself.

This simple cli tool watches the releases set in config, and notifies you with E-mail or PushBullet.

Requirements
--------
* NodeJS 8.x or newer
* (Optional) PushBullet Api Key
* (Optional) SMTP credentials

Either one of the PushBullet or the SMTP credentials are required to get notifications.

Installation
--------
You can install and run alerthub with some simple steps:

1. Clone this repository or get the latest release version
2. Navigate to the folder, and run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run init` to copy the configuration file
4. Edit `etc/config.js`, and fill your credentials.
5. Run `npm start` or something like `pm2 start npm -- start` and run the application.

Docker
--------
You can also run alerthub through a Docker container. See [kmlucy/docker-alerthub](https://github.com/kmlucy/docker-alerthub).

* A portable storage solution such as SQLite etc.
